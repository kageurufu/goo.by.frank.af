  <ul>
    <li>5.25% PVP-K30 (weight by volume)</li>
    <li>2.25% PVA (weight by volume)</li>
    <li>50% Isopropyl Alcohol in h2o</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This amounts to a 70:30 ratio of PVP to PVA in solution, or 21g of PVP-K30 and
    9g of PVA for 400ml of 50% Isopropyl. The actual dilution is up to you, this
    recipe is for a concentrated solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    PVA is highly soluble in water, so I mixed 9g of PVA in 200ml distilled water.
    I heated this on my print bed to 70c, and over about an hour it fully
    dissolved easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    PVP-K30 is readibly soluble in alcohol or water, but I already dissolved the
    PVA in water, so I mixed 21g of PVP in 200ml of 99% Isopropyl alcohol. Gentle
    swirling and stirring and the PVP basically dissolved on it's own.

  <p>
    Combine the solutions, stir well, and portion into small bottles for use. I
    used some cheap
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Precision-Applicator-FANDAMEI-Painting-Quilling/dp/B089GNCKLV">needle-tip precision
      applicator PET bottles</a> for my mix, although the labels that came with that
    set don't stick to the bottles at all. A little packing tape fixed that.

  <p>
    If you wanna confuse the <abbr title="toynbee">chemists</abbr>, add a little
    bit of dye to give it a nice color, and don't tell them. Laugh as they start
    wildly postulating on what could be contaminating your solution

  <h4>For the lazy</h4>
  <p>
    Just ignore everything above. Combine everything, mix with 50% isopropyl
    alcohol, and shake until its dissolved.
